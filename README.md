# Facial Emotion Recognition System

## Project Overview
This project is a **Facial Emotion Recognition System** that captures a real-time photo using a webcam, predicts emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.), and recommends relevant content such as songs, games, and quotes. The system is built using **Deep Learning and Computer Vision** and aims for high accuracy (80-95%).

## Features
- **Real-time Emotion Detection** using a webcam.
- **Emotion Classification** based on the FER2013 dataset.
- **Personalized Recommendations** (Songs, Games, Quotes) based on emotions.
- **Web-Based Interface** (Responsive for both Mobile & PC).

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (OpenCV, Deep Learning Libraries)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (For Model Training)
- **Flask** (Backend API for Integration)
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS** (Frontend for Web App)
- **Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook** (For Model Training & Testing)
